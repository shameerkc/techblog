# How to Bootstrap your First Material-2 Project

[Material2 Library](https://material.angular.io/) provides an amazing library of GUI components, built using Google's [Material Design Specification](https://material.google.com/).

This blog is written as part of an internal learning project we did. Please check the source [here](https://github.com/shameerkc/material2-starter-project).
This project will help you setup your first Angular2 project to start with Material Design. Though the original [Material2 repository](https://github.com/angular/material2) provides some examples, it is difficult to understand as it shared multiple files with the original repository.

## Steps to Do
* Use angular-cli to generate your new project.
* Install the relevant Material Components. In the example, I have installed all material components.
* The related icon library is also served locally by installing relaed packages through NPM.

### Pending work
* Production build is having some issues. Debugging currently under progress.
* Planning to include an example to explain the Routing concept. The Routing Design has been changing a lot on Angular2 and in many cases, the existing application may not be working.
