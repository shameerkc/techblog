# How to Setup Angular2 DEV Environment behind Corporate Proxy

[Angular-2](https://angular.io/) is an amazing framework for fast web development across all platforms.

Though the framework provides very useful documentation, setting up the environment is a nightmare if you work behind corporate proxies.

The initial setup requires online connectivity and many steps fail if you have own firewall proxy setup in place.
